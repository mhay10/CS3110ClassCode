# CS 3110 Project Proposal

This proposal is for a simple tennis tournament manager that will be able to handle multiple tournaments with multiple brackets per tournament.

## Reason for Project Creation

The reason behind this project is due to other tournament management programs either being locked behind proprietary systems (e.g. USTA), being bloated with ads, or having limited access due to pricing structures.

This project aims to create a simple, easy to use platform for managing tournaments without having to pay for useful features or deal with constant ad intrusions.

## Target Audience for Project

This project's target audience is people who want to run tennis tournaments. Managing a large tournmament can be very stressful and having to use poor quality software does not help ease that stress.

## Project Plan

This project will have the following features:

- Creation and management of multiple tournaments
- Multiple brackets per tournament (e.g, singles, doubles, etc.)
- Easy player adding and seeding
- Automatic bracket creation based on number of players

The project will also use the following tech stack:

- Vue.js frontend
- Express.js backend
- MongoDB database

# Plan for First Sprint

For the first sprint of the project, I hope to implement the following

- Get simple node server running
- Create good mongoDB schema to use for storing data
- Create simple welcoming homepage on frontend

  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Why this exists</h1>
  <p>
    I created this app because I didn't like the existing solutions for running
    <br />
    tennis tournaments. They were either propretiary software, bloated with ads,
    <br />
    or cost money to use effectively. My solution is a simple, free to use app
    <br /> that anyone can use to run their tournaments easily.
